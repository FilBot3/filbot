# filbot - your friendly neighborhood chat bot

filbot in its current state is written in Golang using the `go-chat-bot` library. As noted on the [go-chat-bot]() GitHub page, and its [corresponding docs](). 

## Running filbot

Filbot requires an environment.sh file to be exporting the environment variables used to supply information to Filbot. These are detailed in the go-chat-bot GitHub README. IRC, Slack, and Telegram all differ. You could run Filbot to talk to all three systems, and export all values. The choice is yours. 

## Requirements

1. Golang Minimum 1.8.3
2. go-chat-bot
